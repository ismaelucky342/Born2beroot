Born2beroot is a 42 school project that involves setting up and managing a Linux server. We must configure a server using the Debian operating system and meet several specific requirements, such as configuring a firewall, installing and configuring an SSH service, configuring system monitoring, among others. The project aims to teach students about system administration, computer security and server configuration.
# Basic Concepts for Evaluation

### What is a LVM (Logical Volume Manager)?
LVM is a method of allocating space on mass-storage devices that creates logical volumes as needed and provides a way to extend volumes on the fly.

### What is UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)?
UFW is a user-friendly interface for managing netfilter firewall, which provides filtering of network traffic in and out of a Linux system.

### What is SSH (Secure Shell)?
SSH is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. It is typically used for remote access to command-line interfaces on servers and other networked devices.

### What is Sudo?
Sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.

### What is Crontab?
Crontab is a UNIX command for scheduling jobs to be executed periodically. It is typically used for running commands or scripts at specified intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.

### What is SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)?
SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It is commonly used to verify data integrity and authenticity.

### What is the role of sudo.log file?
The sudo.log file logs all sudo command usage, including the user who executed the command, the command itself, and any errors or output generated by the command.

### What is the purpose of the monitoring.sh script?
The monitoring.sh script collects various system metrics, such as CPU load, memory usage, disk usage, network connections, and system uptime, and outputs them in a formatted message. This script can be scheduled to run periodically to monitor system performance.

### What is the purpose of the signature.txt file?
The signature.txt file contains a cryptographic hash of the Virtual Machine's disk image file. This hash value can be used to verify the integrity of the disk image and ensure that it has not been tampered with.

### What is the purpose of the Born2BeRoot evaluation checklist?
The Born2BeRoot evaluation checklist provides a comprehensive list of tasks and questions that must be completed and answered correctly to pass the Born2BeRoot evaluation. It serves as a guide for evaluating the student's understanding and proficiency in setting up and securing a Debian-based server.

### ü•≥ CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE NOW FINISHED! NEXT IS THE EVALUATION üîΩ

## Part 8 - Born2BeRoot Defence Evaluation with Answers

[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BwCO0udUP7MhRh81Y681zz0BalXtKFtte_FHJc6G4s/edit) to the [Born2BeRoot Evaluation Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BwCO0udUP7MhRh81Y681zz0BalXtKFtte_FHJc6G4s/edit) created by [Adrian Musso-Gonzalez](https://github.com/AdrianMussoGonzalez).

### The Evaluation Questions

### Why did I choose Debian?
Easier to install and configure so better for personal servers.

### Difference between Debian and CentOS?
Debian is a lot easier to update then CentOS when a new version is released. Debian is more user-friendly and supports many libraries, filesystems and architecture. It also has more options for customisation. If you are a larger business CentOS offers more Enterprise features and excellent support for the Enterprise software. 

![1*EUhkzOMoiT_KEF3j402O6g](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58959408/175495740-d4599f59-25b1-43ba-9c01-ba4246096f8a.png)

### What is a Virtual Machine?
Is a resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs or apps. Each VM has its own operating system and functions separately, so you can have more than one VM per machine. Can be used to test applications in a safe, separate environment. Works by using software to simulate virtual hardware and run on a host machine.

### What is the difference between aptitude and APT (Advanced Packaging Tool)?
* Aptitude is a high-level package manager while APT is lower level which can be used by other higher level package managers
* Aptitude is smarter and will automatically remove unused packages or suggest installation of dependent packages
* Apt will only do explicitly what it is told to do in the command line

### What is AppArmor?
Linux security system that provides Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security. Allows the system admin to restrict the actions that processes can perform. It is included by default with Debian. Run aa-status to check if it is running.

### Password Rules
For the password rules, we use the password quality checking library and there are two files the common-password file which sets the rules like upper and lower case characters, duplicate characters etc and the login.defs file which stores the password expiration rules (30 days etc).
Sudo nano /etc/login.defs
Sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password

### What is LVM
Logical Volume Manager ‚Äì allows us to easily manipulate the partitions or logical volume on a storage device. 

### UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) 
UFW is a interface to modify the firewall of the device without compromising security. You use it to configure which ports to allow connections to and which ports to close. This is useful in conjunction with SSH, can set a specific port for it to work with.

### What is SSH?
SSH or Secure Shell is an authentication mechanism between a client and a host. It uses encryption techniques so that all communication between clients and hosts is done in encrypted form. User on Mac or Linux can use SSH the terminal to work on their server via SSH.

### What is Cron?
Cron or cron job is a command line utility to schedule commands or scripts to happen at specific intervals or a specific time each day. Useful if you want to set your server to restart at a specific time each day. 

- `cd /usr/local/bin` ‚Äì to show monitoring.sh
- `sudo crontab -u root -e` ‚Äì to edit the cron job
- `change script to */1 * * * * sleep 30s && script path` ‚Äì to run it every 30 seconds, delete the line to stop the job from running.

### Evaluation Commands for UFW, Group, Host, lsblk and SSH

- `sudo ufw status`
- `sudo systemctl status ssh`
- `getent group sudo`
- `getent group user42`
- `sudo adduser new username`
- `sudo groupadd groupname`
- `sudo usermod -aG groupname username`
- `sudo chage -l username` - check password expire rules
- `hostnamectl`
- `hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname` - to change the current hostname
- Restart your Virtual Machine.
- `sudo nano /etc/hosts` - change current hostname to new hostname
- `lsblk` to display the partitions
- `dpkg -l | grep sudo ‚Äì` to show that sudo is installed
- `sudo ufw status numbered`
- `sudo ufw allow port-id`
- `sudo ufw delete rule number`
- `ssh your_user_id@127.0.0.1 -p 4242` -  do this in terminal to show that SSH to port 4242 is working
